#Endless Delve
The aim of the game is to delve as deep into the dungeon as possible, filling your pockets with as much treasure as you can along the way. But be careful.. The deeper you delve the more dangerous its inhabitants become and the greater the toll on your insanity. The aim of the game is to collect as much treasure as possible before you perish to your insanity or die to the many dangers lurking in the dungeon.
The player spawns at the entranceway on the top row of the map and must navigate through the maze of deadly rooms to reach the exit door on the bottom row.
The player begins on the start menu where they must enter their character name..
